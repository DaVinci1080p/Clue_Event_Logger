*NOTE: Legacy Interface is currently not working, as it does not read correctly* 


## Description
This application was created to provide players with a way to easily record their clue scrolls in bulk, or over the course of their clue runs.

## How to install
### Copy and paste this into your browser to install automatically
#### alt1://addapp/https://redx1000.github.io/OpenLogger/appconfig.json
### Or use direct link
#### https://redx1000.github.io/OpenLogger
#### To install with the direct link
1. Copy the direct link
2. Open Alt1 applications and open the browser
3. Paste link in URL bar and press enter
4. Click Add App on the top of the page
5. Accept permissions and click confirm

 ## How to use
 ### Capture Rewards
1. Open a reward casket (Easy, Medium, Hard, Elite, Master)
    * Make sure clue reward window is not obfuscated in order to get a correct reading.
2. Press the Capture button or press Alt+1 to record the clue interface.
3. Wait a bit, recording takes between 1 - 5 second depending on the tier of clue and the amount of rewards in the window.
4. Rewards appear in the OpenLogger Interface along with the value, and a dynamic display that updates when new rewards come in, along with the total and average value for the number of completed clues.

### Autocapture
* Clues can be autocaptured by clicking on the lock (Closed == On, Open == Off).
* This is turned off by default. Click the lock to enable it.
* Be careful when obfuscating details in the clue window, more specifically "Current Reward Value: X" coins and "Reroll Reward ( X )".
* Easy way to fix a misread is to disable autocapture and rolling back and recapturing it.
* If items are not read when capturing, it is most likely caused by icons loading in. Manually reroll and the clue should be automatically recaptured. Sorry slow internet peoples ðŸ˜”. I'll add a manual sleep delay in settings later.
* In the event of a double-read, pause Autocapture, rollback, and open the next casket, then re-enable autocapture.

### Export to CSV
* Export to CSV will create a CSV value of the LocalStorage and allow the user to download the file
* This will be useful for storing data long term or for crowdsourcing data

### Rollback
* Rollback will rewind to the last rewards logged by one clue.
* Maybe support for further rollbacks will be added later, but for now you only get one.

## Clear DB Options
* Clear DB Options has multiple choices that determine the scope of how much you want to delete from the Database of items
* There are confirm windows for each option.
1. Clear currently selected tier: Clears the database of quantities, values, and clue counts from the currently selected tier.
2. Clear all items from database: Clears the database of quantities, values, and clue counts from all tiers, Easy to Master.
3. Completely reset OpenLogger: Nuclear option, **COMPLETELY** resets OpenLoggers settings and database. This is a recommended last option for troubleshooting. A value within `localStorage` may or may not change between updates (I try not to), and if it turns out that it breaks it, give this a try, otherwise reach out to me and we'll chat about it ðŸ™‚.

## Settings
* Settings allow for user choice of Algorithm for icon recognition, list of reference images used for icon recognition, and for miscellaneous settings toggles.
* Hover over the corresponding buttons title to learn more about what it does.

### Image Searching Algorithm
* So far only ResembleJS works. Pixelmatch is in the works, and I want to hybridize the two in the future.
1. ResembleJS: Image recognition library that compares entire images and returns a percentage value. It is slow, but it is very accurate. 
    * Recommended image collections: OrgList or OrgMinus, due to its accuracy
2. Pixelmatch (WORK IN PROGRESS): Image recognition library that compares images pixel by pixel for and returns a percentage value. It is very fast, but it loses in accuracy due to the variance in pixels
    * Recommended image collections: All images or TwoPlus, due to its inaccuracy, it needs more reference materials
3. Hybrid (WORK IN PROGRESS): A mix of the two. Pixelmatch runs first then ResembleJS.

### Reference Image Collection
1. All Items List: Complete, full list of reference images. Takes the longest to compare
2. Two or more List: List of items, where items that appear in two or more tiers are compared with the clue tiers items. Takes the second longest to run
3. Organized List: List of items where items are located in their respective tier. Best for a balance of speed and accuracy
4. Organized Minus: Smallest list of items. OrgList but with less duplicates. Best for speed, but worst for accuracy due to lower variance.
5. Experimental (WORK IN PROGRESS): Do not touch. I'm playing around with a different library of images, it WILL break.

### Miscellaneous Toggles
1. Reroll detection: Determines whether rerolls should be detected or not when capturing clues. When on, rerolls trigger a rollback of the previous reward and logs the new rewards. 
2. Lag Detection: Determines whether lag should be detected when scanning clues. When on, it will try to rescan it again. It cannot detect if the last item was unscanned, so if it doesn't scan it, rollback and try again.

## Potential and planned updates & Releases
* Legacy interface support. It can read values, but not icons at this time.
* Allowing the user to deposit or withdraw a reward or value into or out of LocalStorage directly in case of a misread.
* Algorithm choice for icon recognition.
* Rollback further than one.
* Allowing download of last clue reward captured
