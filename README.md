*NOTE: Legacy Interface is currently not working, as it does not read correctly* 


## Description
This application was created to provide players with a way to easily record their clue scrolls in bulk, or over the course of their clue runs.

## How to install
### Copy and paste this into your browser to install automatically
#### alt1://addapp/https://redx1000.github.io/OpenLogger/appconfig.json
### Or use direct link
#### https://redx1000.github.io/OpenLogger
#### To install with the direct link
1. Copy the direct link
2. Open Alt1 applications and open the browser
3. Paste link in URL bar and press enter
4. Click Add App on the top of the page
5. Accept permissions and click confirm

 ## How to use
 ### Capture Rewards
1. Open a reward casket (Easy, Medium, Hard, Elite, Master)
    * Make sure clue reward window is not obfuscated in order to get a correct reading.
2. Press the Capture button or press Alt+1 to record the clue interface.
3. Wait a bit, recording takes between 1 - 5 second depending on the tier of clue and the amount of rewards in the window.
4. Rewards appear in the OpenLogger Interface along with the value, and a dynamic display that updates when new rewards come in, along with the total and average value for the number of completed clues.

### Autocapture
* Clues can be autocaptured by clicking on the lock (Closed == On, Open == Off).
* Be careful when obfuscating details in the clue window, more specifically "Current Reward Value: X" coins and "Reroll Reward ( X )".
* Easy way to fix a misread is to disable autocapture and rolling back and recapturing it.
* In the event of a double-read, pause Autocapture, rollback, and open the next casket, then re-enable autocapture.

### Clear Database
* Clear Database will refresh the LocalStorage for that one tier.
* It does **NOT** have a confirm window, so be careful not to click it on accident (Will try to add one later).

### Export to CSV
* Export to CSV will create a CSV value of the LocalStorage and allow the user to download the file
* This will be useful for storing data long term or for crowdsourcing data

### Rollback
* Rollback will rewind to the last rewards logged by one clue.
* Maybe support for further rollbacks will be added later, but for now you only get one.

## Settings
* Settings allow for user choice of Algorithm for icon recognition, List of reference images used for icon recognition, and for miscellaneous settings toggles.
* Hover over the corresponding buttons title to learn more about what it does.

### Reference Image Collection
1. All Items List: Complete, full list of reference images. Takes the longest to compare
2. Two or more List: List of items, where items that appear in two or more tiers are compared with the clue tiers items. Takes the second longest to run
3. Organized List: List of items where items are located in their respective tier. Best for a balance of speed and accuracy
4. Organized Minus: Smallest list of items. OrgList but with less duplicates. Best for speed, but worst for accuracy due to lower variance.
5. Experimental: Do not touch. I'm playing around with a different library of images, it WILL break.

### Miscellaneous Toggles
1. Reroll detection: Determines whether rerolls should be detected or not when capturing clues. When on, rerolls trigger a rollback of the previous reward and logs the new rewards. 

## Potential and planned updates & Releases
* Legacy interface support. It can read values, but not icons at this time.
* Clear database confirmation (`confirm()` does not work in Alt1).
* Allowing the user to deposit or withdraw a reward or value into or out of LocalStorage directly in case of a misread.
* Algorithm choice for icon recognition.
* Rollback further than one.
* Allowing download of last clue reward captured
