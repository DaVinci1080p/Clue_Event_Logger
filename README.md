 ## How to use
 ### Capture Rewards
1. Open a clue scroll
    * Make sure clue reward window is not obfuscated in order to get a correct reading.
2. Press the Capture button or press Alt+1 to record the clue interface.
3. Wait a bit, recording take between 2 - 5 second depending on the tier of clue and the amount of rewards in the window.
4. Rewards appear in the OpenLogger Interface along with the value, and a dynamic display that updates when new rewards come in, along with the total and average value for the number of completed clues.

### Clear Database
* Clear Database will refresh the LocalStorage for that one tier.
* It does **NOT** have a confirm window, so be careful not to click it on accident (Will try to add one later).

### Export to CSV
* Not working yet, but it is supposed to return a string value of all of the rewards in LocalStorage for data management purposes for the user.

### Self Insert Into DB
* Not working yet, but it is supposed to allow the user to deposit a reward or value into LocalStorage directly in case of a misread.
