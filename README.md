 # Instructions on how to use
 ### Capture Rewards
1. Open a reward casket (Easy, Medium, Hard, Elite, Master).
    * Make sure clue reward window is not obfuscated in order to get a correct reading; list of things to not obfuscate at [Additional Information](#additional-information) and [Avoiding menus causing multi-capturing](#a-few-tips-on-where-to-avoid-having-menus-appearing-over-the-value).
2. Press the Capture button, press Alt+1, or enable Autocapture to record the clue reward interface.
3. Wait a bit, recording can be less than 600ms or over 5 seconds seconds depending on the tier of clue, the amount of rewards in the window, the image searching algorithmn used, and the image collection library used (Some users experience longer times than usual. Tweak with the settings or DM me if this happens).
4. Rewards appear in the OpenLogger interface with the value, and a dynamic display that updates when new rewards come in, the total number of clues logged, and the total and average value for the number of completed clues.
<br><br>
### Autocapture
* Clues can be autocaptured by clicking on the lock (Closed == On, Open == Off).
* This is turned off by default. Click the lock to enable it.
* When opening settings or Clear Options Menu buttons, autocapture is automatically disabled.
* **Be careful when obfuscating details in the clue window**, more specifically "Current Reward Value: X" coins and "Reroll Reward ( X )".
* List of things to not hover over below at [Additional Information](#additional-information) and [Avoiding menus causing multi-capturing](#a-few-tips-on-where-to-avoid-having-menus-appearing-over-the-value)
* Easy way to fix a misread is to disable autocapture, rolling it back and recapturing it, unless value is obfuscated and it triggers a multi-capture. One would need to edit values within `localStorage`. 
* If some items are not reading when capturing, it is most likely caused by icons loading in. Check to see if Lag Detection settings are on in the OpenLogger settings and manually roll it back. The clue should be automatically recaptured.
* In the event of a multi-capture from not obfuscating the value, pause Autocapture, rollback, and open the next casket, then re-enable autocapture.
<br><br>
### Export to CSV
* Export to CSV will create a CSV file of the your clue rewards from `localStorage` and allows the user to download the file.
* This will be useful for storing data long term or for crowdsourcing data, i.e. A clan casket opening event.
<br><br>
### Rollback
* Rollback will rewind to the last rewards logged by one clue.
* Maybe support for further rollbacks will be added later, but for now you only get one.
<br><br>
## Clear Options Menu
* Clear Options Menu has multiple choices that determine the scope of how much you want to delete from the database of items.
* There are confirm windows for each option except Refresh page.
1. Reset Settings: Sets settings back to default settings. Default settings are marked with an asterisk or in hover-over text.
2. Clear currently selected tier: Clears the database of quantities, values, and clue counts from the currently selected tier.
3. Clear all items from database: Clears the database of quantities, values, and clue counts from all tiers, Easy to Master.
4. Completely reset OpenLogger: Nuclear option, **COMPLETELY** resets OpenLoggers settings and database. This is a recommended last option for troubleshooting. A value within `localStorage` may or may not change between updates (I try not to), and if it turns out that it breaks it, give this a try, otherwise reach out to me on Discord and we'll chat about it ðŸ™‚. 
5. Refresh page: Refreshes the plugin webpage, does not delete anything.
<br><br>
## Toggleable loot tabs
* Click on the loot tab title to hide the loot, and click it again to show the loot.
* Hidden tabs will be strikethroughed, and the space below it will be hidden.
* Hovering over it will give a tooltip on whether you can hide or show the loot.
<br><br>
## Settings
* Settings allow for user choice of Algorithm for icon recognition, list of reference images used for icon recognition, and for miscellaneous settings toggles.
* Hover over the corresponding buttons title to learn more about what it does.
<br><br>
### Image Searching Algorithm
1. ResembleJS: Image recognition library using [`ResembleJS`](https://github.com/rsmbl/Resemble.js) that compares entire images and returns a percentage value. It is slow, but it is very accurate. 
    * Recommended image collections: OrgList or OrgMinus, for best speed results.
2. Pixelmatch: Image recognition library using [`Pixelmatch`](https://github.com/mapbox/pixelmatch) that compares images pixel by pixel for and returns a percentage value. It is very fast, but can be less accurate than ResembleJS.
    * Recommended image collections: OrgList or OrgMinus, but you can use any library with good speed. There is a known issue with TwoPlus and All Items libraries listed below.
    * Pixelmatch has an issue where some items read incorrectly while using TwoPlus and All Images, i.e. Huge plated adamant salvage being read as Huge plated rune salvage. Send me a DM on discord if you run into other misreads with this configuration. 
3. ##### Hybrid: A mix of the two. Pixelmatch runs first then ResembleJS. Great balance of speed and accuracy. Enabled by default.
    * Recommended image collections: OrgList and OrgMinus.
    * You could use TwoPlus or All Images for more items to compare. It shouldn't make a big difference in accuracy, especially with how Hybrid works. 
    * When using Hybrid, TwoPlus and All Images works perfectly, but takes longer.
    * Hybrid precision can be adjusted using Hybrid Alg Precision setting in the settings menu, listed below.
<br><br>
### Reference Image Collection
1. All Items List: Complete, full list of reference images. Takes the longest to compare.
2. Two or more List: List of items, where items that appear in two or more tiers are compared with the clue tiers items. Takes the second longest to run.
3. Organized List: List of items where items are located in their respective tier. Best for a balance of speed and accuracy. Enabled by default.
4. Organized Minus: Smallest list of items. OrgList but with less duplicates. Best for speed, but worst for accuracy due to lower variance.
<br><br>
### Miscellaneous Toggles
1. Reroll detection: Determines whether rerolls should be detected or not when capturing clues. When on, rerolls trigger a rollback of the previous reward and logs the new rewards. 
2. Lag Detection: Determines whether lag should be detected when scanning clues. When on, it will try to rescan it again. In the event that it does not capture everything due to lag, perform a manual rollback and try again.
3. Multi button prevention: Prevents the user from accidentally multi-logging a clue by disabling the capture button when autocapture is on and when the plugin is trying to capture a clue.
4. No Menu Highlighter: Displays a box where the user should prevent menus appearing at all costs while AutoCapture is on. A menu appearing in this area could potentially cause a double capture that cannot be rolled back. More information on how to avoid a multi-capture, [click here](#a-few-tips-on-where-to-avoid-having-menus-appearing-over-the-value).
5. Hybrid Alg Precision: Allows the user to adjust the precision of the Hybrid image recognition algorithm.
    * The lower the value, the higher the precision. The higher the precision, the faster it runs, but the less accurate it could potentially be, and vice versa. 
    * Default value is 0.3, minimum value is 0.1, maximum value is 1.0. Setting this value higher or lower than this will be auto-capped.

* ### A few tips on where to avoid having menus appearing over the value
    * It IS **_NOT_** safe to have a menu pop up if covering ONLY the value itself. OpenLogger WILL capture if you cover up the value such that ONLY the value is covered up like this:<br>![Menu covering only the value](/dist/images/menu%20screen1.png "Menu covering only value")

    * It **_IS_** safe to hover over or right click items as long as the menu resulting from it can cover the "Current Reward Value" text, but try to avoid it. A few examples of safe menus:<br>
    ![Hover-over menu covering both value and 'Current Reward Value'"](/dist/images/menu%20screen2.png "Hover-over menu covering both value and 'Current Reward Value'")<br>
    ![Right click menu covering only the 'Current Reward Value'"](/dist/images/menu%20screen3.png "Right click menu covering only 'Current Reward Value'")

* ### This plugin stores data using `localStorage` within Alt1, therefore it can remember all of the loot you have gotten between sessions unless it is deleted. To completely refresh it:
    * Select "Completely Reset OpenLogger" in the Clear Options Menu and select "Reset Everything" or:<br><br>
    1. Right click 
    2. Inspect element
    3. Application tab
    4. Storage
    5. Local Storage
    6. right click the link
    7. Clear
<br><br>
## Potential or planned updates
* Better legacy interface support. I don't test with it much. Legacy interface can log clues and perform lag detection checks, but I do not have a reroll window detection set for legacy mode, and I would need to iron out any bugs or kinks that appear. Use at your own risk.
* Allowing the user to deposit or withdraw a reward or value into or out of `localStorage` directly in case of a misread.
* Rollback further than one.
* Allowing download of last clue reward captured.
